# gpu-stress-test

~~1. find a good name for the "gpu benchmark" based on what keyword gets the most search queries~~
2. for v1 build a simple command line tool someone can run on their laptop
3. make a plan on what exactly are getting collected (which data) and put it into a nice frontend
    - make a list of all big competitors and see how they do it
4. launch it with the CLI tool only first
5. build a GUI as well people can use which also displays a nice monitorinf when the GPU runs the stress test
